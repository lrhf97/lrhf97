- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lrhf97
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in starting a new career in Data Analysis
- ðŸŒ± Last summer I completed a 9 month Post Graduate Diploma in Applied Data Science (python, SQL, ML) from Emeritus and Columbia Engineering, I have 
taken multiple StackSkills classes on Web Dev and other areas (NLP), and reading 2-3 domain books at a time.... all while continuing a career
as a Real Estate Agent, training for a few ultrarunning races, and listening to Great Courses lectures on history on said runs.

I have started a few projects to practice my skills and learn new ones.  I am really looking forward to the day that I can do this as a career.
