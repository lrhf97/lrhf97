- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lrhf97
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in starting a new career in Data Analysis
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing up a 9 month Post Graduate Diploma in Applied Data Science (python, through ML) from Emeritus and Columbia Engineering,
taking multiple StackSkills classes on Web Dev and other areas (NLP), and reading 2-3 domain books at a time.... all while continuing a career
as a Real Estate Agent, training for non-existant trail runs (thanks covid), and listening to Great Courses lectures on history on said runs.
